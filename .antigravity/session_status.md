# Session Resumption Status

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED (2026-07-10).** This file is stale (last updated 2026-06-12, well before the Competition/Gamification phase and the #290–301 hotfix chain). Read `docs/project-memory/COWORK_HANDOFF.md` for current state. This file should be updated automatically by `sre-devops` at the end of each delivery going forward — see `.antigravity/instructions.md` §1.

- **Last Active Session End**: 2026-06-12
- **Active Branch**: `main` (Clean working tree)
- **Latest Commit**: `3ae5c92` ("clean: remove misplaced and obsolete admin students assessments sub-route")
- **Last Walkthrough Report**: [walkthrough.md](file:///C:/Users/shail/.gemini/antigravity/brain/4fa773f1-5b4c-4bc1-90ef-93ba27cc34e7/walkthrough.md)

## Accomplished in Current Session
- **Live Database Password Sync**: Programmatically reset demo passwords for Teacher `MP-T-001` and Student `MP-ST-001` using a custom scratch script, resolving all 401 Unauthorized errors on the live platform. (2026-07-21 note: the literal passwords this originally recorded were removed as part of a security audit -- see `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_2026-07-21.md`. Both accounts need a fresh password rotation; this stale value should not be assumed current or reused.)
- **Injected Theme Bootstrap Fix**: Corrected the theme initialization hook in Playwright tests so it sets `mathpath_theme` local storage values instead of writing directly to the document element, eliminating startup TypeErrors and allowing pages to bootstrap correctly.
- **Clean Light Mode Sweep**: Ran the full regression sweep for Light Mode. All 4 sweeps passed (PUBLIC, ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT) visiting 37 routes with zero failures.
- **Deleted Misplaced Route**: Fully removed the misplaced/obsolete route `app/admin/students/assessments/` which was causing a redirect error because of its student-only role check.
- **Documentation Updated**: Integrated live-target, theme variables (`MATHPATH_THEME`), and credential setups into [MATHPATH_VERIFICATION_README.md](file:///c:/Users/shail/OneDrive/Shailesh/Work/Math%20Path/Platform/MathPath_Platform_Live/MathPath-Platform/frontend/MATHPATH_VERIFICATION_README.md).

## Pending Next Steps (For Next Session)
- **Dark Mode Sweep**: Execute the full Dark Mode sweep on the live site:
  ```powershell
  $env:MATHPATH_THEME="dark"; $env:MATHPATH_REPORT_DIR="verification-report/dark"; npx playwright test tests/mathpath-platform-verification.spec.ts --config=playwright.config.ts
  ```
- **Conventions Audit (Dark Mode)**: Audit role palette color conventions, tabs, and metrics layout alignments under dark theme.
- **Visual Glitch Resolution**: Fix any identified dark mode display/color regressions.
