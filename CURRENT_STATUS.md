# Current Platform Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-17

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED AS THE PRIMARY ENTRY POINT (2026-07-10).** This file predates the Competition/Gamification work of July 2026 and the July 8–10 hotfix chain (#290–301). Read `docs/project-memory/COWORK_HANDOFF.md` first for current repo state, then `git log --oneline -30`.

## Current Phase: Mock Exam and Competition Phase

### State of the Platform
- The **Competition Mock Practice** Phase is **COMPLETE AND STABLE (Phase 10)**.
- **Backend:** Services handling mock exam generation, assignments, and attempts are fully locked down with robust permissions (`competition_mock_generation_service.py`, `competition_mock_attempt_service.py`, etc.).
- **Frontend:** Routes for Mock Studio, Mock Tracker, Student Attempts, and Results are fully deployed and polished across Admin, Teacher, and Student portals.
- **Legacy Features:** The YLM Phase 1 (Lessons 1-8, 5 DPS) and the Assessment Builder improvements (expanding levels, enhanced results filtering) remain fully stable.

### Recently Completed Tasks
- Finished Phase 10 Rollout Package.
- Purged dead code and console logs.
- Enforced gamified components and strict Light/Dark mode Teacher Text Overrides (`!text-slate-950 dark:!text-white`).
- Validated a flawless Next.js Production Build.
- Finalized MathPath AI Brain Context Machine for future epics.
- Added the project-memory continuity system under `docs/project-memory/`.
- Fixed MM mock generator defaults, section locking, concept sequencing, and preview rendering cleanup.
- Added MM mock question freshness: no duplicate sums/questions inside a mock and no repeats from the previous 15 active same-level MM mocks.

### In Progress / Next Immediate Tasks
- Keep `docs/project-memory/DAILY_HANDOFF.md` and `docs/project-memory/DAILY_LOGS/` updated after every work session.
- Verify live MM mock draft generation after deploying the 15-mock freshness change.
- Await the user's next MathPath product or QA request.
