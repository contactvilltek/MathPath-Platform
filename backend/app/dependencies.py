    """Normalize a DB-read timestamp to timezone-aware UTC, floored to whole
    seconds, before comparing it against a JWT's `iat`.

    Two independent precision mismatches were found and fixed here while
    testing the 2026-07-21 security audit Phase 2 force-logout feature:

    1. SQLite (used locally/in CI) silently drops tzinfo on read-back even
       for a DateTime(timezone=True) column populated with an aware UTC
       value -- every value this app ever writes to password_changed_at/
       session_invalidated_at is UTC, so a naive value read back is always
       implicitly UTC too. Comparing it against the always-aware
       `iat`-derived datetime without this normalization raises
       "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes". Postgres
       (production) preserves tzinfo correctly, so this half of the fix is a
       no-op there, but it's applied unconditionally so correctness never
       depends on which database is running underneath it.
    2. A JWT's `iat` claim is a whole-number Unix timestamp (sub-second
       precision is truncated at encode time), but session_invalidated_at/
       password_changed_at are stored with microsecond precision. A user who
       force-logs-out and immediately re-authenticates in the same wall-clock
       second could get a brand new token whose truncated `iat` still
       compares as "before" the microsecond-precise revocation timestamp,
       incorrectly rejecting a token that was issued after the revocation in
       real time. Flooring to whole seconds here matches the JWT's own
       precision and removes the race entirely.
