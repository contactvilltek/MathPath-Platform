"""Curriculum config for Preparatory Module (PM) Level 1, Lessons 1-15.

Per product decision (2026-08-04): PM-L1's first 15 lessons must be an exact
replica of Bridge Module's first 15 lessons (BL-1..BL15), because a student
can enter the platform via three separate paths -- YLM, Bridge, or PM-L1 --
and all three must land students at the same competency level before
Intermediate/Master Module. PM-L1's own prior/legacy 26-lesson curriculum is
intentionally not used or referenced here.

Source of truth: Bridge Module Excel (Bridge Level.xlsx), first 15 sheets,
cross-checked against the matching lesson image assets (Lesson-1..Lesson-15,
5 DPS each) supplied alongside it. Every DPS below reproduces that lesson's
taught concept, complement technique, and target number(s) -- not the exact
literal numbers from the spreadsheet (those are a fixed static worksheet;
the platform generates a fresh, validated worksheet per publish/attempt the
same way every other module does), but the same Golden-Step-style concept
family, movement type, and difficulty pattern.

PM has no dedicated question_engine package (unlike YLM/IM/MM). Any module
code other than "MM"/"IM" falls back to the YLM generator
(see generation_service.generate_preview/persist_question_set), driven
entirely by the DPSSection row's own concept_family/operation_focus/
abacus_rule/target_numbers/digit_pattern/generation_template fields -- there
is no YLM-specific "safety net" lesson-rule override for module_code="PM"
(enrich_config_with_lesson_rule() only applies when module_code == "YLM"),
so this config is the actual, only source of generation behavior for PM-L1.

Two small additions were made to the shared engine to support this:
  - question_engine/ylm/operands.py: `_direct_bases()` gained "2D_FULL"
    (arbitrary two-digit bases 10-99), "3D_HUNDREDS" (round hundreds
    100-900), and "3D_FULL" (arbitrary three-digit bases 100-999) digit
    patterns, needed for Lesson 2's double/triple-digit direct practice.
    Purely additive -- YLM's own 32 lessons never use these values.
  - question_engine/ylm/operands.py: `_lesson_templates()` now scopes
    REVISION_TEMPLATE_SCHEDULES lookups to module_code == "YLM". That table
    is keyed only by a bare lesson_number (1-32) and was authored for YLM's
    own lesson map; without this scope, PM-L1 lessons 7/12/13 (which reuse
    those same lesson numbers) would have silently inherited YLM's unrelated
    revision-template rotation for that number instead of falling back to
    their own configured revision_templates.
