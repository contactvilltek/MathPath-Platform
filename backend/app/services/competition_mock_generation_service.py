# IM-L4:
#   - Section 6 is "BODMAS" only, not "BODMAS and Solve Equation" -- Solve
#     the Equation does not exist anywhere in the IM-L3 curriculum
#     (confirmed absent across all 12 lessons), and every real IM-L3 BODMAS
#     expression uses the exact-division template
#     (bodmasTemplate="L3_EXACT_DIVISION", zero remainder), never a squared
#     term.
#   - Multiplication/division digit patterns are narrower than L4's (only
#     2Dx2D/3Dx1D/4Dx1D multiplication and 3D-4D/1D-2D division ever appear
#     in the L3 workbook -- no 3Dx2D/4Dx2D multiplication or 4D/3D division
#     at all), Skill Stacker's Times is fixed at 10 (never random, unlike
#     L4), and Concept Drill's FROM/LESS bands are the same narrow range
#     the audit found repeated identically across every L3 lesson that has
#     one.

# IM-L2 competition mock structure -- its own sections/concepts, built
# directly from the IM-L2 curriculum audit in
# app/question_engine/im/curriculum_map.py's _IM_L2_MAP (IM2 Lvl 6.xlsx,
# audited 2026-07-18; see that block's module-level comment for the full
# audit trail). Confirmed with Shailesh: L2 uses only 6 sections, not L3/L4's
# 8 -- Squares and Positional/Placement are both dropped because neither
# concept has real substance in this level (Squares appears in exactly one
# section header across all 60 DPS with zero real question data behind it;
# Positional/Placement never appears anywhere in the workbook at all), so
# including either as a standalone competition section would test a concept
# the level doesn't actually teach. The remaining 6 sections cover every
# concept that genuinely exists in IM-L2:
#   - Add/Less (Abacus) and Add/Less (Visual) are split exactly like L3/L4.
#     L2's own distinguishing trait: Borrowing is ONLY ever the "positive
#     answers" variant here (borrowingMode="POSITIVE") -- L3/L4's NEGATIVE
#     and POSITIVE_NEGATIVE borrowing modes never occur in this workbook.
#   - Multiplication/Division digit patterns are narrower than even L3's:
#     multiplication never exceeds 4D x 1D (no 2Dx2D/3Dx2D pairs) and
#     division never exceeds 3D/2D (no 4D/2D, 4D/3D, and no Long Division &
#     Estimation variant anywhere) -- confirms L2 sits a full step below L3
#     on both axes.
#   - BODMAS uses the same exact-division shape as L3 (A+BxC-D/E+F, D/E
#     always exact) but with L2's own division digit pattern, (3,1), used in
#     every single BODMAS instance in the workbook (L3 varies between (4,1)
#     and (3,2)), and its own narrower A/B magnitude bands.
#   - Skill Stacker's answer formula is a plain product, ADD x TIMES -- not
#     L3/L4's ADD x 2^(TIMES-1) doubling formula (verified against multiple
#     exact answer-key matches during the audit) -- carried through here via
#     skillStackerLinear=True on every Skill Stacker pool entry. TIMES is a
#     fixed constant that steps once mid-level (5 for the first ~8 lessons,
#     6 for the last ~4), both variants included below.

# every level. IM_COMPETITION_LEVEL_REGISTRY is the single source of truth
# for which levels currently have a defined mock structure; generation code
# must resolve a level's structure through _ImCompetitionLevelConfig() below
# rather than referencing IM_COMPETITION_SECTION_DEFINITIONS/
# IM_COMPETITION_SECTION_CONCEPT_POOLS directly, so that requesting a mock
# for a level that hasn't been configured yet fails loudly with a clear error
# instead of silently generating another level's content under a different
# level's name. To add a new level, add its own entry here with that level's
# own sections/concepts -- do not extend an existing level's.

    No override: even split, base + remainder to the first few sections in

    already correctly handles a section a level's own registry never
    defines at all (it's simply absent from SectionDefinitions, so the
    split only ever divides across however many sections the level
    actually has).

    With an override (the admin's live per-section allocation, e.g. from
    the mock-studio Section Allocation panel): a section given a positive
    count keeps that EXACT number -- an admin's deliberate custom
    allocation is never silently changed. A section left at 0 or missing
    from the override is OFF. Previously, omitting a section this way just
    shrank the mock's total by whatever that section would have carried
    (`RequestedQuestionCount = sum(SectionCountsOverride.values())` in
    GenerateCompetitionMockDraft). Now: if the admin's explicit positive
    allocations add up to less than TargetTotal -- exactly what happens
    when a section gets zeroed out without hand-rebalancing everything else
    -- the shortfall is spread evenly (remainder to the first few, in
    definition order) across whichever sections are still ON, so the
    mock's total always lands on its intended target instead of coming up
    short. If the explicit allocations already meet or exceed TargetTotal,
    they're honored as-is (an admin's specific numbers are never shrunk to
