"""Preparatory Module's own competition-mock section registry and question
collector -- the PM counterpart to the MM/IM logic in
competition_mock_generation_service.py, kept in a fully separate file per
product decision (2026-08-04): every module gets fully dedicated curriculum
logic so a failure or future change in one module's mock/assessment
generation can never silently affect another.

PM-L1 has exactly 3 sections (Section 1 - Addition, Section 2 -
Subtraction, Section 3 - Add/Less), covering every addition/subtraction
pattern taught across its 15 lessons (see
app/seed/preparatory_module_l1_config.py), flat 1 mark per question --
there is no Skill Stacker/Concept Drill equivalent in PM, so none of IM's
weighting machinery applies here.

Section 3 - Add/Less is not "some of each direction" -- it is the native,
genuinely-mixed generation (both + and - within the very same question)
that only exists in three places across all 15 lessons: Lesson 1's 1D/
1D_AND_2D direct add-less, Lesson 2's 2D_FULL/3D_HUNDREDS/3D_FULL direct
add-less, and Lesson 11 DPS5's complement-of-10 add-less for target 5.
Every other lesson (3-10, 12-15) is locked to a single direction per
lesson even where its own DPS5 is labelled "MIXED_REVISION" (that mixes
COMP5/COMP10 technique, not addition/subtraction direction) -- those stay
exclusive to Sections 1/2 via the operation-focus-split entries already
in _addition_pool()/_subtraction_pool() below. Section 3 reuses the same
underlying DPS concepts with their native operation_focus="ADD_LESS"
instead of the artificially split ADDITION/SUBTRACTION-only versions.

The only things imported from the shared MM/IM file are two generic,
doc-confirmed-as-shared distribution utilities
(_RedistributeSectionCounts, _DenseSectionNumbering) -- pure "split N
across sections" and "assign 1..N display numbers to non-empty sections"
math with no curriculum content of its own, already explicitly designed to
serve "every current and future MM/IM level" per that file's own docstring.
Everything that actually describes PM's curriculum (section definitions,
concept pools, question construction) is authored here, independently, and
calls PM's own dedicated generator (app/question_engine/pm) directly.
