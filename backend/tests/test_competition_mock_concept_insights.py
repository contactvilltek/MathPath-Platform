"""Regression coverage for the 2026-07-19 competition-mock Strengths/Areas to
Improve fixes.

Two separate things are covered here:

1. Threshold dead zone: _section_performance_from_review() and the
   equivalent concept_totals loop in SubmitCompetitionMockAttempt() used to
   split strengths at >=75% and weaknesses at <60%, leaving a silent 60-74%
   dead zone where a section or concept appeared in neither list -- even
   though every UI label advertises a single 70% cutoff ("Strengths >= 70%
   Accuracy" / "Areas to Improve < 70% Accuracy").
2. Concept identity: Strengths/Areas to Improve must show the individual,
   student-recognizable concept (e.g. "BODMAS", "2D × 2D Multiplication"),
   not a broad section rollup -- but a small, confirmed set of synthetic
   generator-only labels ("BODMAS Competition Challenge" and similar) must
   collapse down to the one real concept name they actually represent. See
   _canonical_competition_concept_name()'s docstring in
   competition_mock_attempt_service.py for the full reasoning.
