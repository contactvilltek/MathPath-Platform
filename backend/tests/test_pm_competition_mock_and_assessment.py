"""Regression coverage for PM-L1's competition mock exam + section-wise
assessment workflow (2026-08-04).

Per explicit product decision, PM-L1 gets exactly 3 sections -- "Section 1 -
Addition", "Section 2 - Subtraction", and "Section 3 - Add/Less" -- covering
every addition/subtraction pattern taught across its 15 lessons (see
preparatory_module_l1_config.py), flat 1 mark per question for both the
mock exam and the assessment (PM has no Skill Stacker/Concept Drill
equivalent, unlike IM). Section 3 was added after Sections 1/2 shipped (see
pm_competition_mock_generation_service.py's _add_less_pool() docstring for
exactly which 3 lessons' concepts feed it and why). This mirrors the exact
architecture IM/MM already use for mocks and assessments
(PM_COMPETITION_LEVEL_REGISTRY sourced from
pm_competition_mock_generation_service.py, read by both the mock generator
and the assessment blueprint/engine services), with PM's own fully
dedicated concept pools, registry, and collector -- see that module's
docstring for why it is a separate file rather than authored inline
alongside MM/IM.

Uses the real seed_preparatory_module.seed() (not hand-built Module/Level
rows) because competition mock generation's _LevelRecords() requires at
least one active DPS row to exist for the level (NO_DPS_FOUND guard) --
PM's own section-locked collector does not read those DPS rows itself, but
the shared dispatch path it's reached through does.
