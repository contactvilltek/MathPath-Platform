# Deployment Log

Last updated: 2026-07-07

## 2026-07-07

### Branch audit through commit `dd9938e`

Observed state:

- `main` and `origin/main` both point to `dd9938e`.
- The 2026-07-07 pushed frontend stack includes:
  - `ec9d041` dynamic `flowState` scoring, tier labels, accuracy/time/insight tooltip content, and fallback question-count estimation
  - `7e4212b` current-week Sunday-to-Saturday heatmap alignment and larger tooltip layout
  - `dd9938e` tooltip text color inheritance fix and additional tooltip sizing polish

Expected deployment:

- Vercel frontend redeploys for the full 2026-07-07 dashboard sequence.
- No backend deploy is required for this sequence.

Verification recorded in repo memory:

- 2026-07-07 local frontend typecheck passed from `frontend/`: `npm.cmd run typecheck`.
- 2026-07-07 local frontend production build passed from `frontend/`: `npm.cmd run build`.
- The successful build still emitted warnings, not failures:
  - Sentry Next.js instrumentation still expects `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` to move into `instrumentation.ts`.
  - Next.js warns that `metadataBase` is not set for social image resolution.
- No browser-executed verification was recorded in this audit for the new tooltip stack.
- No new CI artifact or live Vercel smoke result is recorded in repo memory yet for `ec9d041` through `dd9938e`.

Change summary:

- The student dashboard grind heatmap moved from a rolling window to the current calendar week.
- Heatmap bars now communicate a derived daily flow score rather than only time-spent magnitude.
- Tooltip presentation now includes tier copy, accuracy/time context, and color/readability fixes.

Remaining:

- Browser-QA the current-week grind heatmap and tooltip behavior on live or preview in both themes.
- Confirm whether the `flowState` formula should keep estimating `5` questions per sheet when `totalQuestions` is absent.
- Add deployment/live-smoke evidence for the pushed July 7 frontend stack.
- Re-run the responsive login matrix in a browser-capable environment so the July 4 login hardening still has browser-backed evidence.

## 2026-07-06

### Continuity audit through commit `4ecd510`

Observed state:

- `main` and `origin/main` still both point to `4ecd510`.
- No newer pushed commits or deployment events were identified in this audit.

Verification recorded in repo memory:

- 2026-07-06 local `npm.cmd run typecheck` failed before the build because `frontend/tsconfig.json` includes `.next/types/**/*.ts` and the generated type files were not fully present in the current checkout state.
- 2026-07-06 local frontend production build passed: `npm.cmd run build`.
- 2026-07-06 local `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed immediately after the build regenerated the required `.next/types` tree.
- The successful build still emitted warnings, not failures:
  - Sentry Next.js instrumentation still expects `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` to move into `instrumentation.ts`.
  - Next.js warns that `metadataBase` is not set for social image resolution.
- The latest responsive login matrix evidence is still the 2026-07-05 local blocked run: Playwright could not launch Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit in this environment (`spawn EPERM`).

Change summary:

- No product code changed in this audit.
- Project memory was refreshed to reflect that the latest local verification path is now `build` first, then `typecheck`, on this checkout.

Remaining:

- Decide whether to make `npm.cmd run typecheck` independent of pre-generated `.next/types`, or explicitly document the required build-first order.
- Collect a successful responsive login matrix run from GitHub Actions or another browser-capable environment.
- Browser-smoke the live or preview login page and the updated student dashboard surfaces.
- Verify deployed auth flows that depend on the backend security-column migration in `7f92d7d`.

## 2026-07-04 to 2026-07-05

### Branch audit through commit `4ecd510`

Observed state:

- `main` and `origin/main` both point to `4ecd510`.
- The 2026-07-04 pushed frontend stack includes:
  - `134eeb2` student dashboard JSX closing-tag compile fix
  - `8979bfc` hook-order hydration fix
  - `303b004` Conquest Matrix date-layout and mock-slideshow polish
  - `c6abde6` grind-heatmap and card-layout refinement
  - `4ecd510` student login responsive hardening and CI responsive-matrix wiring

Expected deployment:

- Vercel frontend redeploys for the full 2026-07-04 stack.
- No backend deploy is required for this sequence.

Verification recorded in repo memory:

- 2026-07-05 local frontend typecheck passed: `npm.cmd run typecheck`.
- 2026-07-05 local frontend production build passed: `npm.cmd run build`.
- The successful build emitted warnings, not failures:
  - Sentry Next.js instrumentation still expects `sentry.server.config.ts` / `sentry.edge.config.ts` to move into `instrumentation.ts`.
  - Next.js warns that `metadataBase` is not set for social image resolution.
- 2026-07-05 local `npm.cmd run verify:student-login-responsive` was attempted against a local `next start`, but all 60 cases failed before page assertions because Playwright could not launch Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit in this environment (`spawn EPERM`).

Change summary:

- Fixed the student dashboard compile break and hydration crash.
- Refined Conquest Matrix date rendering and mock slideshow support.
- Changed the dashboard grind heatmap to scale by time spent rather than only completion count.
- Hardened the shared login page for mobile/landscape/zoom use cases and added responsive regression coverage to CI.

Remaining:

- Collect a successful responsive login matrix run from GitHub Actions or another browser-capable environment.
- Browser-smoke the live or preview login page and the updated student dashboard surfaces.
- Decide whether to clean the current Sentry instrumentation and `metadataBase` build warnings now.

## 2026-06-29

### Branch audit through commit `c4d2ddf`

Observed state:

- `main` and `origin/main` both point to `c4d2ddf`.
- The 2026-06-29 pushed stack includes:
  - `590e1dc` login UX streamline
  - `fdc0aab` global responsive layout fixes
  - `4502bdd` student login hardening
  - `7f92d7d` backend user security-column schema migration
  - `d091e7b` through `bbffb96` student typography/result standardization
  - `416bf88` through `c4d2ddf` header/logo cleanup and enlarged image-only branding

Expected deployment:

- Vercel frontend redeploys for the frontend commits above.
- Render backend redeploys for `4502bdd` and `7f92d7d`.

Verification recorded in repo memory:

- `590e1dc`: daily log says the login UX changes were typechecked, built, and merged via PR `#59`.
- `fdc0aab`: daily log says the responsive-layout changes were compiled, tested, and merged via PR `#61`.

Evidence gap:

- No recorded local test/build output yet for `4502bdd`, `7f92d7d`, or the later student-page/header sequence.
- No recorded live browser smoke yet for role login, responsive student pages, or the latest logo/header behavior.
- No recorded deployed-environment confirmation yet that the schema migration in `7f92d7d` ran successfully.

Remaining:

- Run `npm.cmd run typecheck` and `npm.cmd run build` after the current local frontend edits are settled.
- Browser-QA Admin/Teacher/Student login and the latest responsive/header behavior on live or preview.
- Verify auth flows that depend on the backfilled security columns after the backend deploy.

## 2026-06-24 to 2026-06-26

### Notifications, mock entry, and UI standardization sequence

Observed pushed work:

- 2026-06-24: commits `5561d34` through `7cfb74a` added and stabilized competition mock notifications, deep links, result routing, mock submission fixes, and remaining MM visual seed cleanup.
- 2026-06-25: commits `3d59b32` through `495e821` added student mock instructions/start-practice flows and polished sticky metric bars and question block sizing.
- 2026-06-26: commits `abddcd0` through `a04ed53` standardized teacher/student metrics, tables, hero copy, typography, and explicitly triggered a Vercel production deploy.

Expected deployment:

- Vercel redeploys for the frontend-heavy UI sequence.
- Render redeploys for the notification/routing backend changes.

Verification recorded in repo memory:

- 2026-06-26 daily log says the UI styling sequence was typechecked, built, and merged via automated PRs `#40` through `#43`.

Evidence gap:

- Repo memory does not currently contain precise live smoke results for the 2026-06-24 through 2026-06-26 notification, start-practice, and table/layout fixes.
- Repo memory does not currently capture a consolidated backend test log for the 2026-06-24 routing/notification sequence.

### Commit `6f96201`

Title: `Align MM visual labels with workbooks`

Pushed to:

- `main`
- GitHub remote `origin`

Expected deployment:

- Render backend redeploy.
- Vercel frontend redeploy may be triggered by the monorepo push, although this change is backend/project-memory focused.
