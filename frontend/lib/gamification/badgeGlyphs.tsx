/* ==========================================================================
 * BESPOKE BADGE GLYPHS -- reference batch (2026-07-27, craft pass)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The five reference badges previously borrowed stock `lucide-react` glyphs
 * (Zap / Gem / Diamond / Layers / Flame). Those are *UI* icons: single-weight,
 * single-path, designed to sit in a 16px toolbar. Blown up to 120px on a
 * cinematic card they read as clip-art, and -- worse -- as interchangeable,
 * which is the exact opposite of "this is a distinct unlock".
 *
 * Everything in this file is drawn by hand, per badge, on a 24x24 grid:
 *   - a soft accent under-layer for depth (fills, no stroke)
 *   - the hero silhouette in `currentColor` (so it inherits the badge's own
 *     `iconColorHex` from whatever renders it)
 *   - internal facet / detail strokes that only make sense for that one badge
 *
 * SCOPE: these five components are used for the five reference-batch iconName
 * keys ONLY. Every other badge in the product keeps its lucide icon, untouched.
 *
 * API: drop-in compatible with the lucide call signature already used across
 * the app -- `<Icon size={n} strokeWidth={n} style={{color}} className="..." />`
 * -- so `BadgeIconMap` / `IconMap` can map to these with no call-site changes.
 * ========================================================================== */

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PHASE 3 (2026-07-29) -- Level Mastery, per-level icons.
 * OPUS ELEVATION PASS (2026-07-29, second pass): the first build of these 15
 * glyphs got the *structure* right -- per-level silhouettes, and a real
 * BASE -> SUPER -> LEGENDARY escalation within each level -- but every
 * LEGENDARY tier reached for the SAME flourish: a 6-ray radial starburst
 * whose ray offsets were literally identical numbers in all five families
 * (+/-3.3,-1.7 and +/-4.7,+0.9 off the anchor), plus the same twin diamond
 * flares and the same dashed line at y=22.6. That is a template, not five
 * designs, and LEGENDARY is precisely the badge a student screenshots.
 *
 * What is PRESERVED (this is the project convention, arrived at after
 * Shailesh rejected an all-tiers-recoloured version -- "the student should
 * feel the difference and that should make them feel good being a higher
 * achievement"):
 *   BASE       -- hollow outline only, zero fill anywhere, sparsest glyph.
 *   SUPER      -- solid single-tone fill + a soft glow + exactly one extra
 *                 structural detail. Calm, finished, but single-tone.
 *   LEGENDARY  -- two-band layered fill + light that deliberately BREAKS PAST
 *                 the glyph's own silhouette and past the 24x24 viewBox edge
 *                 + a small particle scatter + an environmental echo.
 *
 * What CHANGED: the *form* that escaping light takes is now argued per badge
 * from what the badge is actually about, and every one of the five escapes
 * the frame along a different axis:
 *   BM-L1   -- a bridge is about SPANNING, so its apex light runs HORIZONTALLY
 *              along the deck and exits both side edges. Plus real suspension
 *              hangers and pier-top lanterns.
 *   MM-L1   -- a summit at night: AURORA ribbons sweeping across the sky out
 *              of both side edges, one 4-point concave beacon star piercing
 *              the top edge, a varied starfield, a secondary ridge.
 *   YLM-L1  -- germination is the only motif here that acts DOWNWARD: the
 *              seed coat splits into two parted halves, roots break past the
 *              BOTTOM edge and the shoot's first leaves break past the TOP.
 *              Both vertical extremes, which nothing else in the set does.
 *   YLM-L2  -- water: dew droplets on the leaf tips, one drop falling in
 *              through the TOP edge, grass blades arcing out of both side
 *              edges, an impact ripple on the soil. No radial rays at all.
 *   YLM-L3  -- dispersal: six CURVED stamens with anthers (built from one
 *              path rotated 6x at 60deg, deliberately off-phase from the 5
 *              petals at 72deg so it reads organic), and a true Archimedean
 *              pollen spiral of nine decaying motes that exits the RIGHT edge.
 *
 * Colours are unchanged from the first pass and remain the real
 * verify-badge-colour-distinctness.mjs numbers (0 FAIL); see the
 * LEVEL_MASTERY_NEW block in that script for each pick's rationale.
 *
 * THIRD PASS (2026-07-30) -- render-and-look. The two passes above were both
 * argued from the code; this one rendered all 15 glyphs to real SVG at badge
 * size, on their real gradients, and judged them side by side. Three findings,
 * two acted on:
 *   1. YLM-L1 was plainly the worst mark in the set. The "asymmetric bean with
 *      a hilum notch" read as a potato at 130px, and its LEGENDARY jagged
 *      crack read as a lightning bolt through a walnut. Rebuilt as a symmetric
 *      OGIVE with a curved suture -- see the SEED_BODY block below. Container
 *      clip-path and the 3D husk radius were re-cut to match.
 *   2. BM-L1 LEGENDARY had two real defects, both invisible in source: the 4
 *      suspension ties at strokeWidth 0.75/alpha 0.85 closed the arch void and
 *      read as a portcullis, and the "water reflection" arc was drawn at a
 *      radius that put almost all of it outside the 24x24 viewBox, surviving
 *      on screen as two disconnected squiggles. Both fixed in place.
 *   3. MM-L1, YLM-L2 and YLM-L3 held up at size and were left alone. Saying so
 *      is part of the judgement, not an omission from it.

/* ==========================================================================
 * MOCK-EXAM BADGE ELEVATION -- BATCH 1 (2026-07-27)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 13 hand-drawn marks for the first 5 real mock-exam badge families.
 *
 * KEY DIFFERENCE FROM THE REFERENCE BATCH ABOVE: those five used invented
 * iconName keys precisely so they could not disturb a live badge. These
 * thirteen deliberately REUSE the backend's own iconName strings ("Target",
 * "Scan", "FastForward", ...) because the goal now is to elevate badges
 * students already hold. That is safe here, and only here, because every one
 * of these fifteen iconName values is used by EXACTLY ONE row in
 * backend/app/services/achievements.py -- verified against the seed list. No
 * other badge shares any of these keys, so overriding them in the icon maps
 * cannot change the appearance of a badge outside this batch.
 *
 * Two of the fifteen are not redrawn: "Zap" (Speed Demon BASE) and "Focus"
 * (Perfectionist SUPER) are aliased onto the already-approved reference-batch
 * marks instead, so the real badges finally render as the artwork that was
 * signed off for them.
 *
 * INK vs LIGHT MARKS: three of these badges sit on high-luminance cards
 * (speed_demon_SUPER citron, unstoppable_streak_SUPER vital green,
 * early_bird_SUPER dawn peach) and carry a DARK iconColorHex. Their baked
 * accent colours below are therefore dark too -- a pale accent that reads
 * beautifully on a navy card disappears entirely on a yellow one, and the
 * accents are literal hexes, not `currentColor`, so they do not follow the
 * ink automatically. Each affected glyph flags this in its own comment.

 * MOCK-EXAM BADGE ELEVATION -- BATCH 2 (2026-07-27)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The remaining 5 real mock-exam families: comeback_kid, podium_finisher,
 * sharpshooter, underdog and polymath (display name "High Achiever" -- the
 * backend `code` really is `polymath`). 15 more hand-drawn marks, same rules
 * as batch 1:
 *
 *   - each of these 15 iconName strings is owned by EXACTLY ONE badge row in
 *     backend/app/services/achievements.py, so overriding them in the icon maps
 *     cannot change any badge outside this batch;
 *   - complexity escalates BASE -> SUPER -> LEGENDARY inside a family, and the
 *     three marks in a family never repeat a primitive (this is the same rule
 *     that stops Perfectionist's Target/Gem/Scan reading as one icon);
 *   - accent hexes are BAKED, not `currentColor`, so they do not follow the
 *     badge's ink. Three badges in this batch sit on high-luminance cards
 *     (comeback_kid_LEGENDARY incandescent rose, podium_finisher_BASE pale
 *     laurel, sharpshooter_LEGENDARY ice) and therefore carry DARK accents.
 *     Each of the three flags this in its own comment.
 *
 * DELIBERATE SEPARATIONS FROM BATCH 1 (checked mark by mark):
 *   - `Crosshair` (sharpshooter BASE) must not restate `Target` (perfectionist
 *     BASE). Target is a struck archery face with a dart in it; Crosshair is an
 *     optical reticle with a mil-dot ladder and a time-elapsed arc, because
 *     this badge is about accuracy AND clock discipline, not about the hit.
 *   - `Radar` (sharpshooter LEGENDARY) must not restate `Scan` (perfectionist
 *     LEGENDARY). Scan is a rectangular instrument frame resolving a lattice;
 *     Radar is polar -- range rings, a rotating sweep wedge and live contacts.
 *   - `Trophy` (podium BASE) must not restate `Medal` (competitor BASE). Medal
 *     is a struck disc on a ribbon; Trophy is the podium itself, three blocks
 *     seen in elevation with the standings implied by their heights.

 * PHASE 1 -- MYTHIC TIER (2026-07-28)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nine hand-drawn marks for the new MYTHIC tier of the nine skill-badge
 * families that did not already have one. (The tenth, perfectionist, got
 * `IconPerfectionistGemMythic` in the reference batch above and is untouched.)
 *
 * CONTRACT: like the reference batch and UNLIKE batches 1 and 2, these are
 * brand-new iconName strings -- `SpeedCometMythic`, `CrownMythic`,
 * `InfinityMythic`, `DawnBreakMythic`, `PhoenixSurgeMythic`,
 * `LaurelCrownMythic`, `PrecisionCoreMythic`, `SummitMythic`, `OracleMythic`.
 * They were seeded by the backend alongside the nine new MYTHIC
 * AchievementBadge rows, so each key is owned by exactly one row and none of
 * them can shadow, or be shadowed by, a key an existing badge resolves through.
 *
 * DRAWING RULE FOR THIS TIER: every mark is the SAME OBJECT its family's
 * LEGENDARY mark draws, escalated -- not a new object. The tier step is carried
 * by (a) an added structural element that only a ceiling tier would earn (a
 * mach cone, a vault arch, an orbital ring, a horizon, a wing pair, a monument,
 * a collapsed core, a summit banner, an opened eye) and (b) a denser internal
 * facet/ray pass. If you can swap one of these with its family's LEGENDARY mark
 * and not notice, it is wrong.
 *
 * THREE OF THE NINE ARE DRAWN FOR A LIGHT CARD (`DawnBreakMythic`,
 * `LaurelCrownMythic`, `OracleMythic`): their badge colour is a high-luminance
 * near-white, so those three take an INK `iconColorHex` and their accent fills
 * are DEEP rather than bright. Bright accents vanish on those cards.

 * PHASE 2 -- FIVE NEW BADGE FAMILIES, FOUR TIERS EACH (2026-07-28)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Twenty hand-drawn marks for Marathoner, Iron Wall, The Veteran, Last-Minute
 * Hero and Section Specialist. Same "brand-new iconName" contract as the
 * reference batch and phase-1 MYTHIC: all twenty strings below were seeded by
 * the backend alongside the twenty new AchievementBadge rows (see the seed list
 * in backend/app/services/achievements.py), each is owned by exactly one row,
 * and none of them can shadow -- or be shadowed by -- a key an existing badge
 * resolves through.
 *
 * DRAWING RULE FOR THIS PHASE: a family is ONE OBJECT redrawn four times, not
 * four objects sharing a colour ramp. Each family therefore has a single
 * structural motif that every tier is obliged to keep, and the tier step is
 * carried by adding structure to that motif rather than by swapping it:
 *
 *   Marathoner         -- a trail in one-point perspective. BASE has one
 *                         milestone; MYTHIC's trail has closed into a loop.
 *   Iron Wall          -- running-bond masonry. BASE is a single brick;
 *                         MYTHIC is a walled citadel built of the same course.
 *   The Veteran        -- the chevron. It is stacked, struck into a medal,
 *                         flown on a standard, and finally built into a
 *                         monument -- but it is the same chevron every time.
 *   Last-Minute Hero   -- a dial with its FINAL WEDGE marked (the last 10% of
 *                         the window, which is literally the unlock rule).
 *                         The wedge sparks, flashes, burns, then eclipses.
 *   Section Specialist -- HEXAGONAL nodes and straight links. Hexagons, not
 *                         circles, specifically so this never reads as
 *                         polymath BASE's round-node plexus (IconMindLattice),
 *                         which is the nearest existing mark.
 *
 * SIX OF THE TWENTY ARE DRAWN FOR A LIGHT CARD -- MarathonHorizon,
 * MarathonEternal, IronWallRampart, LastMinuteFlash, SectionSpecialistGrid and
 * SectionSpecialistNexus. Their badge colour has WCAG relative luminance above
 * 0.45, so those six take an INK `iconColorHex` and every baked accent constant
 * below them is DEEP rather than bright. The accents are literal hexes, not
 * `currentColor`, so they do not follow the ink automatically -- a pale accent
 * that reads on a navy card is invisible on a near-white one.
