// MOCK-EXAM BADGE ELEVATION -- BATCH 1 (2026-07-27)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The first 5 of the 10 real mock-exam badge families (15 of the 30 live
// badges) are re-graded below. Scope discipline for this pass:
//
//   * PRESENTATIONAL ONLY. Not one AchievementBadge row, code, tier,
//     required_count or unlock rule was touched. Students who already hold
//     these badges hold exactly the same badges; they just look different.
//   * The other 5 families (comeback_kid, podium_finisher, sharpshooter,
//     underdog, polymath) are BYTE-FOR-BYTE UNCHANGED below and are scheduled
//     for batch 2.
//   * `perfectionist_SUPER`, `perfectionist_MYTHIC` and `speed_demon_BASE`
//     were graded in the reference batch and are deliberately NOT re-graded
//     here -- they are inputs to this pass, not outputs of it.
//
// HOW THESE 13 COLOURS WERE CHOSEN (and why they are not hand-picked)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The rule is that no two badges may share a colour identity. That is a
// perceptual claim, so it is measured, not asserted:
// `frontend/scripts/verify-badge-colour-distinctness.mjs` computes CIEDE2000
// across all 18 gated colours (these 13 + the 5 frozen ones) and prints every
// pairwise distance. Result for this palette: 143 pairs, 0 fail, 0 warn,
// tightest pair dE00 = 19.3 (unstoppable_streak_BASE vs perfectionist_SUPER),
// tightest pair among the 13 NEW colours = 23.1.
//
// The first, hand-picked draft FAILED that check: "vital green" at hue 100 and
// "green-flash emerald" at hue 132 read as 32 degrees apart in HSL and measured
// dE00 5.9 -- the same chip. Hue degrees are not perceptual distance (green is
// compressed, blue is expanded), so the final values come from a constrained
// max-min-dE00 search over thematic hue/chroma windows instead of from taste.
//
// Every `burst[0]` below IS the badge's identity colour, because burst[0] is
// what BadgeInspectionModal feeds to the 3D scene lights, the ambient
// particles and the star field. Grading anything else would grade a value the
// viewer never actually sees at full strength.
//
// `iconColorHex` is picked off WCAG relative luminance, not HSL lightness:
// hsl(62,96%,50%) (speed_demon_SUPER) is nominally "mid lightness" but has
// ~0.85 relative luminance, so it takes an INK glyph. Three badges in this
// batch do (speed_demon_SUPER, unstoppable_streak_SUPER, early_bird_SUPER).

  // ===================================================================
  // MOCK-EXAM BADGE ELEVATION -- BATCH 2 (2026-07-27)
  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  // The remaining 5 families. Same scope discipline as batch 1: PRESENTATIONAL
  // ONLY -- no AchievementBadge row, code, tier, required_count or unlock rule
  // was touched, and every batch-1 / reference-batch entry above is
  // byte-for-byte unchanged and was treated as a fixed input here.
  //
  // HOW THESE 15 COLOURS WERE CHOSEN
  // Same method, harder problem. The gate is now 33 colours (18 already graded
  // + these 15) all mutually >= 18 dE00, and by the time batch 1 shipped the
  // easy regions of sRGB were gone: bright yellow, orange, red, cyan, azure,
  // cobalt, jade, vital green, magenta, orchid, gold, bronze, peach, petrol,
  // pewter and pearl were all spoken for. A farthest-point search over the
  // remaining volume showed the theoretical ceiling for 15 more colours is
  // dE00 ~19; this palette lands at 19.08 in free search and 18.56 once each
  // badge is also constrained to a thematically legible hue window. There is
  // no arrangement of 15 pretty, saturated, well-spaced colours left -- some of
  // these are deliberately low-chroma or deep, and that is a consequence of the
  // measurement, not a lapse.
  //
  // The two family narratives that had to move off the brief's first sketch,
  // and why:
  //   * PODIUM FINISHER is laurel, not metal. Champagne and platinum both
  //     measured inside 12 dE00 of early_bird_SUPER's dawn peach and
  //     perfectionist_MYTHIC's pearl respectively; a third near-neutral was
  //     also blocked by competitor_BASE's pewter. Laurel (the actual podium
  //     symbol) was free, and it keeps this family clear of Competitor's
  //     pewter/red/gold, which was the real requirement.
  //   * SHARPSHOOTER cannot be three cold colours. After azure, cyan, cobalt,
  //     indigo and petrol, exactly two cold holes remained. The family is
  //     therefore gunmetal -> steel -> ice: still one temperature, but two of
  //     the three are carried by lightness and chroma rather than hue.
  //
  // Podium's three tiers all sit in the green-yellow band, which is the one
  // place this batch relaxes batch 1's "no two tiers share a hue region" rule.
  // It is relaxed knowingly and it is measured: the three are 21.6 (BASE-SUPER),
  // 30.2 (SUPER-LEGENDARY) and 43.2 (BASE-LEGENDARY) dE00 apart -- wider than
  // the tightest ACCEPTED pair anywhere in the catalogue -- and they span 43.6
  // units of CIELAB L* and 54.1 of chroma. They cannot read as "the same badge
  // with bigger text", which is what the rule exists to stop.
  // ===================================================================

  // --- Comeback Kid ----------------------------------------------------
  // A heat ramp, because that is literally the story: something that was going
  // out gets hotter. Ember -> flare -> incandescence. All three are warm, and
  // all three had to fit between competitor_SUPER's signal red, the demo chain
  // badge's orange and early_bird_SUPER's peach -- which is why the arc runs
  // through pink at the top rather than through yellow (yellow-white at high L*
  // measured 13 dE00 from dawn peach and 14 from citron; rose measured 21+).
  //
  // BASE -- EMBER RUST. The banked coal. Lowest L* of the family (28.5) and the
  // only badge in the catalogue in the deep red-brown region; nearest
  // neighbour is competitor_SUPER's signal red at dE00 19.5, held apart on
  // lightness and chroma together (L* 28.5 vs 43.3, chroma 32.4 vs 86.6).

  // --- Podium Finisher -------------------------------------------------
  // The wreath, not the medal. See the block note above for why the metals
  // were unavailable.
  //
  // BASE -- PALE LAUREL. Fresh, unremarkable, correct: this is "you made the

  // --- Sharpshooter ----------------------------------------------------
  // One temperature, three instruments: gunmetal -> steel -> ice.
  //
  // BASE -- GUNMETAL. Near-neutral with a cold cast (chroma 11.7, hue 240).
  // The third-lowest-chroma badge in the catalogue, behind competitor_BASE's
  // pewter (9.2) and underdog_BASE's basalt (9.7), and 31.5 dE00 clear of the
  // pewter almost entirely on L* (27.3 vs 61.0) -- the two are "dark tool

  // SUPER -- STEEL. The tightest gated pair in the entire catalogue: dE00 18.6
  // against perfectionist_BASE's jade. The two are close in L* (56.2 vs 58.8)
  // and are separated on chroma instead -- 14.4 vs 40.3, i.e. jade is nearly

  // LEGENDARY -- ICE. L* 92.4, the second-brightest card in the catalogue after
  // perfectionist_MYTHIC's pearl, and 21.0 dE00 from speed_demon_BASE's cyan --
  // the pair a naive "both are blue-green" reading would call identical, and

  // --- Underdog --------------------------------------------------------
  // The only deliberately EARTHY family in the catalogue. Everything else here
  // is a light source, a jewel or a metal; this one is dirt, rope and rock,
  // which is the read the badge wants ("beat the odds from nowhere") and also
  // the reason it can occupy the muted mid-chroma region nothing else wanted.
  //
  // BASE -- BASALT. Dark, almost achromatic warm stone (chroma 9.7 -- second
  // only to competitor_BASE's pewter at 9.2, and the two are 30+ dE00 apart on
  // lightness). Nearest neighbour is early_bird_BASE's antique bronze at dE00
  // 18.6, separated by chroma (9.7 vs 37.1) rather than by hue: bronze is a lit

  // LEGENDARY -- GRANITE MOSS. Lichened summit rock. Cool-shifted away from

  // --- High Achiever (backend code `polymath`) -------------------------
  // True violet, and specifically NOT the two violets already in use:
  // perfectionist_SUPER's amethyst-magenta (#9b1fd6) and
  // unstoppable_streak_LEGENDARY's orchid (#f84fd6). Both of those are
  // high-chroma magentas; this family is built on the blue side of violet and
  // on lightness contrast instead.
  //
  // BASE -- LAPIS INK. Muted, bookish, low chroma (27.0). Nearest neighbours
  // are competitor_BASE pewter (18.6) and perfectionist_SUPER amethyst (19.1);
  // it clears the amethyst by 72 units of chroma (27.0 vs 99.4), not by hue.

  // ===================================================================
  // PHASE-1 MYTHIC TIER (2026-07-28)
  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  // The 9 new MYTHIC badges for the existing skill-badge families.
  // Perfectionist's MYTHIC (opal, above) already shipped and is a FIXED INPUT
  // here -- it is not re-graded, and neither is any BASE/SUPER/LEGENDARY entry.
  //
  // HOW THESE 9 COLOURS WERE CHOSEN -- and why the method inverted this time.
  // Batches 1 and 2 picked hexes first and drew glyphs to match. Here the
  // hand-drawn MYTHIC glyphs in ./badgeGlyphs ALREADY EXISTED and already
  // carried a per-badge palette in their hardcoded accent constants
  // (SDM_VIOLET tachyon violet, CRM_SAPPHIRE imperial sapphire, INM_TURQ
  // eternal turquoise, PCM_ROSE singularity rose, SUM_SKY summit sky, ...), and
  // three of them are explicitly annotated "DRAWN FOR A LIGHT CARD". That
  // artwork is committed, so it was treated as the anchor: each colour below is
  // the most perceptually-separated point available INSIDE its own glyph's hue
  // family, at a lightness that matches the card polarity its glyph assumes.
  // Colour follows the drawing here, not the other way round.
  //
  // THE HARD PART, honestly stated. The gate is now 42 colours (33 already
  // graded + these 9) and the easy sRGB is long gone. An unconstrained
  // farthest-point CIEDE2000 search -- no thematic constraint at all, free to
  // put all 9 anywhere in the colour solid -- puts the theoretical ceiling for
  // 9 more colours at dE00 16.06. So batch 1's "every gated pair >= 18" is
  // ARITHMETICALLY UNREACHABLE at this catalogue size and 0 WARN is not an
  // option any palette could have hit. This set lands at 12.50 minimum while
  // staying inside the glyphs' hue families, and every pair clears the FAIL
  // line (dE00 >= 12, and no pair is both HSL-triple-near and < 18). The WARN
  // band is therefore populated ON PURPOSE and is documented per entry below,
  // following the precedent already set by sharpshooter_SUPER (18.6, the
  // tightest ACCEPTED pair in batch 2) rather than silently widening a
  // threshold. Rarity is carried by effects, particles and audio -- which is
  // exactly the escape hatch batch 1 wrote down for when hue runs out.
  //
  // MYTHIC's shared visual language, and why it is not a colour: every entry
  // below is a MULTI-STOP gradient that passes through a white or near-white
  // blowout at its centre -- the "there is still light inside" move that
  // perfectionist_MYTHIC introduced. That is what makes a MYTHIC card read as
  // above its own LEGENDARY (all 9 LEGENDARYs are 2-stop ramps) without
  // needing a hue nobody else has.
  //
  // burst[0] is the graded primary in every case: BadgeInspectionModal feeds
  // burst[0] to the 3D scene's lights and ambient particles (`Env* color`), so
  // it is chosen to be a colour that can actually light a scene, never a
  // near-black. iconColorHex is set by WCAG relative luminance against the
  // card, not by eye -- the four INK marks below are the four cards over 0.45.
  // ===================================================================

  // speed_demon_MYTHIC -- TACHYON VIOLET. The comet does not go faster; it goes
  // PAST light, and the blueshift wraps off the end of the visible spectrum.
  // That is the one read that escalates BASE's cyan without re-using it.
  // Chroma 105.3 -- the most saturated colour in the entire catalogue, which is
  // the point of a ceiling tier. Nearest neighbours are perfectionist_SUPER's
  // amethyst and unstoppable_streak_LEGENDARY's orchid, both at dE00 12.5:
  // WARN, accepted. It clears both on lightness and chroma together (L* 55.0 vs
  // 45.4/65.6, chroma 105.3 vs 99.4/78.6) and neither is HSL-triple-near.
  // Violet at this lightness is boxed in on all sides by those two; 12.5 is the
  // widest gap that exists between them.
  // ICON-CONTRAST FIX (2026-07-29): iconColorHex was #fdf2ff (near-white)
  // against a background that passes through #ffffff at 42% -- a WCAG
  // contrast of 1.01, i.e. the icon was visually invisible against its own
  // badge, confirmed live via browser screenshot. Every other badge using
  // this "opal, light-center" gradient shape (perfectionist_MYTHIC,
  // unstoppable_streak_MYTHIC, etc.) correctly uses a DARK ink glyph for
  // exactly this reason -- this one just missed it. Fixed to #2a0350, which
  // is not an arbitrary black but the gradient's own 100% stop (deep
  // violet), so the icon reads as "the dark end of this badge's own
  // palette" rather than a mismatched color. New contrast: 15.9.

  // competitor_MYTHIC -- IMPERIAL SAPPHIRE. The family's LEGENDARY is struck
  // gold, so MYTHIC deliberately does NOT go "more gold": a brighter gold is
  // the exact "same badge, bigger text" failure this catalogue exists to avoid,
  // and it measured inside 12 of competitor_LEGENDARY anyway. The coronation
  // stone instead of the coronation metal -- and it is 56.4 dE00 off its own
  // LEGENDARY, the widest in-family MYTHIC step in this batch.
  // Nearest neighbour is perfectionist_LEGENDARY's azure at dE00 13.1 (WARN):
  // separated on chroma, 36.1 vs 58.6, i.e. a stone versus an instrument beam.
  // ICON-CONTRAST FIX (2026-07-29): same class of bug as speed_demon_MYTHIC
  // above -- iconColorHex was #eff8ff (near-white) against this gradient's

  // ===================================================================
  // PHASE 2 -- FIVE NEW FAMILIES, FOUR TIERS EACH (2026-07-28)
  // -------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Marathoner, Iron Wall, The Veteran, Last-Minute Hero and Section
  // Specialist. Every entry above is a FIXED INPUT and none is re-graded --
  // no existing badge's code, tier, colour or glyph is touched by this pass.
  //
  // HOW THESE 20 COLOURS WERE CHOSEN, and the arithmetic first.
  // The gate is now 62 colours. A FREE farthest-point CIEDE2000 search -- 20
  // points placed anywhere in sRGB with the existing 42 held fixed and no
  // thematic constraint at all -- maximises the smallest new distance at
  // dE00 13.50 (greedy over a 23k-point grid restricted to CIELAB L* 22..97,
  // i.e. excluding the near-blacks and near-whites that cannot light a 3D
  // scene). This palette lands at 13.46: 99.7% of the unconstrained ceiling,
  // while ALSO keeping every badge inside a hue window its theme survives.
  // Batch 1's "every gated pair >= 18" has been arithmetically unreachable
  // since phase 1 measured its own ceiling at 16.06 for nine colours; at 62
  // colours it is not close. The WARN band is therefore populated on purpose,
  // documented per entry, and the property that actually holds is the one that
  // means "these cannot be confused": every gated pair clears FAIL (dE00 >= 12,
  // and no pair is simultaneously HSL-triple-near and < 18).
  //
  // The method: seed from the holes the free search actually found, assign each
  // hole to the badge whose theme could justify it, then re-optimise by
  // coordinate ascent inside a per-badge thematic box. Two family themes moved
  // as a direct result of the measurement rather than of taste, exactly as
  // batch 2's champagne/platinum and three-cold-colours findings did:
  //
  //   * LAST-MINUTE HERO IS NOT FOUR HOT COLOURS. Only two genuinely hot holes
  //     were left in the whole catalogue -- after signal red, vermillion,
  //     incandescent rose, orange, ember rust, phoenix ember, plasma rose,
  //     singularity rose, dawn peach, citron, gold, genesis solar, bronze and
  //     tan, the warm band is full. So the family runs struck amber ->
  //     flashbulb lime -> scorched gold -> eclipse plum: a DEADLINE arc (the
  //     spark, the blown-out flash, fire seen through smoke, and finally the
  //     dark of the deadline itself) instead of a heat ramp. The brief's own
  //     MYTHIC direction -- an eclipse, dark-before-light -- is what made that
  //     arc available, and it is still the exact opposite temperature from
  //     Early Bird, which was the actual requirement.
  //   * IRON WALL IS THREE NEUTRALS PLUS ONE. Brick, quarry stone and pale
  //     limestone are the masonry; the near-neutral band cannot hold a fourth
  //     entry alongside competitor_BASE's pewter, sharpshooter_BASE's gunmetal
  //     and underdog_BASE's basalt, so MYTHIC leaves it for verdigris -- the
  //     citadel's aged bronze rather than its stone.
  //
  // MYTHIC's shared language is unchanged from phase 1: all four new MYTHIC
  // entries are MULTI-STOP gradients passing through a white or near-white
  // blowout at the centre, which is what makes a MYTHIC card read as above its
  // own LEGENDARY without needing a hue nobody else has.
  //
  // burst[0] is the graded primary in every case (BadgeInspectionModal feeds it
  // to the scene lights and ambient particles), and iconColorHex is set by WCAG
  // relative luminance against that primary, not by eye. The SIX ink marks
  // below are the six cards over 0.45.

  // 16.1 and last_minute_hero_MYTHIC at 17.0, both held on lightness (L* 44.9

  // REFERENCE BATCH (2026-07-27) -- brand-new codes, purely additive.
  // These two `code` values do not exist in the backend AchievementBadge
  // table yet -- staged ahead of the next badge-build phase (the temporary

  // 2026-07-28 as part of shipping the existing-30 elevation; these config
  // entries themselves are left in place since they're real work product,
  // not dev-only scaffolding).
  // ===================================================================

  // Level Mastery -- its own visual axis (architectural, per-level shapes),
  // kept deliberately outside every skill-badge palette so a level badge can
  // never read as a reskinned skill badge. The reference-batch demo entry
  // that used to sit here ("level_mastery_intermediate_1_LEGENDARY") never
  // matched a real backend code and is superseded by the real Level Mastery
  // build starting below (real codes: level_mastery_{level_code}, derived
  // dynamically from the live Level table -- see seed_badges() in
  // backend/app/services/achievements.py).

  // ===================================================================
  // PHASE 3 (2026-07-29) -- Level Mastery, real badges, built in small
  // batches per Shailesh's request (batch N reviewed live before batch N+1
  // starts). Batch 1: BM-L1 (Bridge module, 1 level -- teal->violet
  // "crossing" identity, distinct from every skill-badge palette and from
  // IM's indigo-emerald). Same icon shape across all 3 tiers (per-LEVEL
  // shapes, not per-tier -- Shailesh's explicit call); tier is expressed
  // entirely through color richness + the environment/cutscene escalation.
  // ===================================================================
  // burst[0] is this project's "primary swatch" convention (verified against
  // verify-badge-colour-distinctness.mjs, not eyeballed). First draft of
  // this family used teal->violet, which measured 8 real FAILs against the
  // existing 61-colour palette (closest: polymath_MYTHIC vs LEGENDARY at
  // dE00 3.0 -- effectively the same chip). That whole hue register turned
  // out to be saturated across the catalogue already (teal/cyan/blue: speed
  // demon, competitor, veteran, iron_wall, unstoppable_streak, marathoner,
  // section_specialist all live there). Re-picked via an actual constrained
  // search against all 61 existing primaries (not eyeballed) -- landed on a
  // "twilight crossing" register instead: deep plum (BASE, dusk begins) ->
  // rich magenta (SUPER, deep twilight) -> pale dusty rose (LEGENDARY, dawn
  // light on the far bank -- apex-tier high-key motif, same pattern as this
  // palette's other pale LEGENDARY/MYTHIC tiers). Every pair clears dE00>=12
  // against the whole existing palette (worst: 12.4, comeback_kid_LEGENDARY)
  // and the 3 tiers clear each other by 29-54 dE00.

  // --- Phase 4: DPS Gamification Overhaul ------------------------------
  // COLOUR AUDIT (2026-08-03): the original 07-31 palette had 8 byte-identical
  // duplicate pairs (dps_midnight/dps_compass/dps_sage were near-total
  // copy-pastes of each other) plus dozens more sub-12 dE00 collisions,
  // confirmed via frontend/scripts/verify-badge-colour-distinctness.mjs.
  // Full 40-colour palette regenerated below using this file's own max-min
  // CIEDE2000 methodology (see scripts/_badge_palette_solver.mjs): every
  // family now keeps one thematic hue lane with real tier-to-tier drift
  // within it, and the 40 colours are verified mutually distinct (worst
  // internal pair dE00 15.99, zero FAILs). Distinctness against the other
  // ~88 existing badges was intentionally NOT chased to a strict pass here
  // -- DPS and non-DPS badges only ever co-occurred in one place (the mock
  // exam leaderboard's topBadges chips), and that leaderboard now excludes
  // DPS badges entirely (see routes_student.py), so cross-category
  // similarity is no longer user-visible. Full before/after numbers in
  // docs/project-memory/DPS_BADGE_COLOR_AUDIT_2026-08-03.md.
