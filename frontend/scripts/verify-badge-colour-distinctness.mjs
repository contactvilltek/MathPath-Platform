/* ==========================================================================
 * BADGE COLOUR DISTINCTNESS VERIFIER
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Written 2026-07-27 for the "mock-exam badge elevation, batch 1" pass (the
 * first 15 of the 30 real mock-exam badges).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The design rule for badge elevation is: every tier of every badge gets its
 * own colour identity -- no two badges may read as "the same thing with
 * different text". That is a perceptual claim, and eyeballing swatches in a
 * code editor is not evidence. This script turns it into a measurement.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, per unordered pair of badge primary colours:
 *   1. CIEDE2000 (dE00) -- AUTHORITATIVE. The CIE's current perceptual
 *      difference metric, computed through sRGB -> linear -> XYZ (D65) ->
 *      CIELAB. Thresholds:
 *         dE00 < 12  FAIL  -- would read as the same chip
 *         dE00 < 18  WARN  -- separable side by side, risky as isolated chips
 *         dE00 >= 18 PASS
 *   2. HSL deltas       -- hue (wrap-aware), saturation, lightness. ADVISORY.
 *      The project shorthand rule is "suspect if hue within ~20 deg AND
 *      saturation within 0.18 AND lightness within 0.15". It is annotated but
 *      it does NOT by itself fail a pair, because HSL is not a perceptual
 *      space and this run proved it misfires in both directions:
 *
 *        - FALSE POSITIVE, blue region. perfectionist_LEGENDARY #149bf5 vs
 *          speed_demon_BASE #22d3ee trips all three HSL conditions
 *          (dH 16.1, dS 0.06, dL 0.01) yet measures dE00 22.9. Azure and cyan
 *          sit 28 CIELAB b* units apart; the blue arc of the hue wheel is
 *          perceptually EXPANDED relative to its degree count, so 16 degrees
 *          there is a large real difference.
 *        - FALSE POSITIVE, yellow region. speed_demon_SUPER #f2fa05 vs
 *          competitor_LEGENDARY #c19915 trips it too (dH 15.9, dS 0.16,
 *          dL 0.08) and measures dE00 25.6 -- because HSL calls them both
 *          "lightness ~0.46" while their CIELAB L* is 95 vs 65 and their WCAG
 *          relative luminance is 0.85 vs 0.34. HSL L is not lightness.
 *        - FALSE NEGATIVE, green region. The first hand-picked draft of this
 *          palette had vital green at hue 100 and green-flash emerald at hue
 *          132 -- 32 degrees apart, comfortably "passing" the HSL rule -- and
 *          they measured dE00 5.9, i.e. genuinely the same chip. Green is
 *          perceptually COMPRESSED. That collision is the reason this file
 *          exists rather than an eyeball sign-off.
 *
 *      So: dE00 decides, HSL annotates, and a pair is only failed on the HSL
 *      rule when dE00 independently agrees it is close.
 *
 * SCOPE (2026-07-27, extended by the batch-2 pass to cover EVERYTHING):
 *   - the 13 newly graded batch-1 colours + the 2 batch-1 carry-overs
 *   - the 15 newly graded batch-2 colours (comeback_kid, podium_finisher,
 *     sharpshooter, underdog, polymath) -- these used to sit in a CONTEXT_ONLY
 *     set that did not gate anything; that set no longer exists
 *   - perfectionist SUPER + MYTHIC and the 3 reference-batch demos, including
 *     `unstoppable_streak_chain` whose orange-crimson the REAL unstoppable
 *     streak family must not be mistaken for
 *
 * So the comparison set is now every badge colour in the product: 33 distinct
 * primaries across 35 rendered badges (perfectionist SUPER and speed_demon
 * BASE each appear in both the reference batch and a real family).
 *
 * WHAT IS GATED: every pair involving a colour graded by batch 1 or batch 2.
 * The only ungated pairs are frozen-vs-frozen ones that pre-date both passes;
 * they are printed in their own section rather than omitted.
 *
 * RUN:  node scripts/verify-badge-colour-distinctness.mjs

/**
 * 9 newly graded PHASE-1 MYTHIC badges (2026-07-28) -- the MYTHIC tier for the
 * 9 skill-badge families that did not already have one. (The 10th,
 * perfectionist_MYTHIC, shipped with the reference batch and is a frozen input
 * here; it stays in REFERENCE_BATCH above and is NOT re-graded.)
 *
 * METHOD INVERTED FROM BATCHES 1 AND 2, and it matters for reading these hexes.
 * Those batches solved for colour and then drew glyphs. Here the hand-drawn
 * MYTHIC glyphs already existed in lib/gamification/badgeGlyphs.tsx with a
 * palette baked into their accent constants (tachyon violet, imperial
 * sapphire, eternal turquoise, singularity rose, summit sky, ...) and with
 * three of the nine annotated "DRAWN FOR A LIGHT CARD". The committed artwork
 * was therefore the fixed input, and each hex below is the best-separated
 * point available inside its own glyph's hue family at the lightness that
 * glyph assumes -- a constrained search, not a free one.
 *
 * WHY THIS SET DOES NOT REACH dE00 18, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A REGRESSION.
 * The gate is now 42 colours. A free farthest-point CIEDE2000 search over the
 * whole colour solid -- 9 points placed anywhere, no thematic constraint at
 * all, holding the existing 33 fixed -- maximises the smallest new distance at
 * dE00 16.06. Batch 1's ">= 18 for every gated pair" is thus arithmetically
 * impossible at this catalogue size for ANY 9 colours, thematic or not, and no
 * choice of hexes here could have produced 0 WARN. This palette reaches 12.50
 * while also respecting the nine glyphs. Every pair still clears the FAIL line
 * (dE00 >= 12, and no pair is simultaneously HSL-triple-near and < 18), which
 * is the property that actually means "these cannot be confused".
 *
 * The WARN band is populated deliberately, and every WARN pair is justified
 * per-entry in the phase-1 MYTHIC block of lib/gamification/badgeVisuals.ts
 * (which axis holds it apart: lightness, chroma, or hue). This follows the
 * precedent batch 2 already set with sharpshooter_SUPER at 18.6 -- name the
 * tight pair, show the axis, do not move the threshold.

/**
 * 20 newly graded PHASE-2 badges (2026-07-28) -- five BRAND-NEW families
 * (Marathoner, Iron Wall, The Veteran, Last-Minute Hero, Section Specialist),
 * four tiers each. Every one of the 42 colours above is a FIXED INPUT and none
 * of them is re-graded.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC, STATED UP FRONT. The gate is now 62 colours. A free
 * farthest-point CIEDE2000 search -- 20 points placed anywhere in sRGB with the
 * existing 42 held fixed, no thematic constraint whatsoever -- maximises the
 * smallest new distance at dE00 13.50 (greedy over a 23k-point grid restricted
 * to CIELAB L* 22..97, i.e. excluding the near-blacks and near-whites that
 * cannot light a 3D scene). This palette lands at 13.46, which is 99.7% of that
 * unconstrained ceiling WHILE ALSO keeping every badge inside a hue window its
 * theme can survive. There is no set of 20 hexes, thematic or not, that could
 * have done materially better, and >= 18 has been arithmetically out of reach
 * since phase 1 (which measured its own ceiling at 16.06 for 9 colours).
 *
 * So: the WARN band is heavily populated by construction, exactly as phase 1
 * documented, and the property that actually matters is the one this palette
 * does hold -- every gated pair clears the FAIL line (dE00 >= 12, and no pair is
 * simultaneously HSL-triple-near and < 18).
 *
 * WHERE THE COLOURS CAME FROM. Seeded from that same free farthest-point run
 * (i.e. from the holes actually left in sRGB), then each seed was assigned to
 * the badge whose theme could justify it, then re-optimised by coordinate
 * ascent inside a per-badge thematic box (max dE00 drift from the seed, plus an
 * L* window set by the card's intended polarity). Two allocations moved during
 * that pass and are worth naming:
 *   * THE AMBER went to last_minute_hero_BASE, not to marathoner_SUPER. Only
 *     two genuinely hot holes were left in the whole catalogue and Last-Minute
 *     Hero is the heat family, so it got first claim; Marathoner's SUPER took
 *     the softer sun-baked ochre above it (L* 71.3 vs 53.5).
 *   * LAST-MINUTE HERO IS NOT FOUR HOT COLOURS, for the same reason batch 2
 *     found "sharpshooter cannot be three cold colours". After signal red,
 *     vermillion, incandescent rose, orange, ember rust, phoenix ember, plasma
 *     rose, singularity rose, dawn peach, citron, gold, genesis solar, bronze
 *     and tan, the warm band is full. The family is therefore struck amber ->
 *     flashbulb lime -> scorched gold -> eclipse plum: a DEADLINE arc (spark,
 *     blown-out flash, fire seen through smoke, and the dark of the deadline
 *     itself) rather than a heat ramp. The brief's own MYTHIC direction --
 *     an eclipse, dark-before-light -- is what made that arc available.
 *
 * IRON WALL is likewise three near-neutrals plus one: brick, quarry stone and
 * limestone are the masonry, and MYTHIC leaves the neutral band for verdigris
 * because the neutral band cannot hold a fourth entry next to pewter, gunmetal
 * and basalt. iron_wall SUPER->LEGENDARY (15.0) and section_specialist
 * BASE->SUPER (15.8) are the two tightest in-family steps here; both are
 * carried by L* (63.0 vs 79.6, and 65.2 vs 73.1) plus chroma.

// Quill, The Midnight Oil, The Golden Compass, Sage's Eye, Unbroken Chain,

// keeps one thematic hue lane with real tier-to-tier drift, verified
// mutually distinct (worst DPS-vs-DPS pair dE00 15.99, zero FAILs).

// (backend/app/api/routes_student.py), so cross-category similarity is no
